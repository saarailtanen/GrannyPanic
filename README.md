With a group of 4 we made a game for our fall project. Game is about a grandma that needs to get to a store. Catch is, that we made the controller by ourselves. It's a wheelchair. Also works with keyboard.

Wheelchair had a hall effect crank sensor for both wheels. Per wheel there is 3D printed frame for 10 magnets. Moving in this game works with when the sensor feels the magnets. The more you spin the wheels the faster you go. We used two ESP32 to process the data and sent it to Unity.

What I did in this project: Coded the menus (main menu, highscore, pause and choosing name after the game), coded the highscore system, helped with building and coding the wiring for the sensors. In game coded moving cats and train.
